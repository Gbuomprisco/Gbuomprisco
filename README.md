## Ciao! This is Giancarlo ðŸ‘‹
### Coder and Founder. I ship products, and help others do the same.

I'm a developer and founder based in ~~London, UK~~ Remote

I'm particularly specialized in using Typescript, Angular, Rx, NestJS, Next.js and React.

I made https://makerkit.dev, a SaaS Starter for Next.js and Remix to ship your SaaS fast.

Sometimes, I blog at https://giancarlobuomprisco.com
